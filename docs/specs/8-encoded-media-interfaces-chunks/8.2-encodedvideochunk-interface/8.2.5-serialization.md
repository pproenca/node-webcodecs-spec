# 8.2.5. Serialization

**The EncodedVideoChunk serialization steps (with value, serialized, and forStorage) are:**
: 1.  If forStorage is `true`, throw a [`DataCloneError`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#datacloneerror).
    
2.  For each [`EncodedVideoChunk`](#encodedvideochunk) internal slot in value, assign the value of each internal slot to a field in serialized with the same name as the internal slot.

**The EncodedVideoChunk deserialization steps (with serialized and value) are:**
: 1.  For all named fields in serialized, assign the value of each named field to the [`EncodedVideoChunk`](#encodedvideochunk) internal slot in value with the same name as the named field.

NOTE: Since [`EncodedVideoChunk`](#encodedvideochunk)s are immutable, User Agents can choose to implement serialization using a reference counting model similar to [§ 9.4.7 Transfer and Serialization](../../9-raw-media-interfaces/9.4-videoframe-interface/9.4.7-transfer-and-serialization.md).

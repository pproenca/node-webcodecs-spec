# 7.2. Clone Configuration (with config)

NOTE: This algorithm will copy only the dictionary members that the User Agent recognizes as part of the dictionary type.

Run these steps:

1.  Let dictType be the type of dictionary config.
    
2.  Let clone be a new empty instance of dictType.
    
3.  For each dictionary member m defined on dictType:
    
    1.  If m does not [exist](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#map-exists) in config, then [continue](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#iteration-continue).
        
    2.  If `config[m]` is a nested dictionary, set `clone[m]` to the result of recursively running the [Clone Configuration](#clone-configuration) algorithm with `config[m]`.
        
    3.  Otherwise, assign a copy of `config[m]` to `clone[m]`.
        

Note: This implements a "deep-copy". These configuration objects are frequently used as the input of asynchronous operations. Copying means that modifying the original object while the operation is in flight won’t change the operation’s outcome.

# 7.4. Codec String

A valid codec string _MUST_ meet the following conditions.

1.  Is valid per the relevant codec specification (see examples below).
    
2.  It describes a single codec.
    
3.  It is unambiguous about codec profile, level, and constraint bits for codecs that define these concepts.
    

NOTE: In other media specifications, codec strings historically accompanied a [MIME type](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#mime-type) as the "codecs=" parameter ([`isTypeSupported()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source-2/#dom-mediasource-istypesupported), [`canPlayType()`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-navigator-canplaytype)) [\[RFC6381\]](#biblio-rfc6381 "The 'Codecs' and 'Profiles' Parameters for \"Bucket\" Media Types"). In this specification, encoded media is not containerized; hence, only the value of the codecs parameter is accepted.

NOTE: Encoders for codecs that define level and constraint bits have flexibility around these parameters, but won’t produce bitstreams that have a higher level or are less constrained than requested.

The format and semantics for codec strings are defined by codec registrations listed in the [\[WEBCODECS-CODEC-REGISTRY\]](#biblio-webcodecs-codec-registry "WebCodecs Codec Registry"). A compliant implementation _MAY_ support any combination of codec registrations or none at all.

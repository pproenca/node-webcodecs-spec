# 9.3.3. Audio channel ordering

When decoding, the ordering of the audio channels in the resulting [`AudioData`](#audiodata) _MUST_ be the same as what is present in the [`EncodedAudioChunk`](#encodedaudiochunk).

When encoding, the ordering of the audio channels in the resulting [`EncodedAudioChunk`](#encodedaudiochunk) _MUST_ be the same as what is preset in the given [`AudioData`](#audiodata).

In other terms, no channel reordering is performed when encoding and decoding.

NOTE: The container either implies or specifies the channel mapping: the channel attributed to a particular channel index.

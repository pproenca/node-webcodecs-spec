# 9.3.1. Arrangement of audio buffer

When an [`AudioData`](#audiodata) has an [`AudioSampleFormat`](#enumdef-audiosampleformat) that is interleaved, the audio samples from different channels are laid out consecutively in the same buffer, in the order described in the section [§ 9.3.3 Audio channel ordering](../../9-raw-media-interfaces/9.3-audio-sample-format/9.3.3-audio-channel-ordering.md). The [`AudioData`](#audiodata) has a single plane, that contains a number of elements therefore equal to [`[[number of frames]]`](#dom-audiodata-number-of-frames-slot) \* [`[[number of channels]]`](#dom-audiodata-number-of-channels-slot).

When an [`AudioData`](#audiodata) has an [`AudioSampleFormat`](#enumdef-audiosampleformat) that is planar, the audio samples from different channels are laid out in different buffers, themselves arranged in an order described in the section [§ 9.3.3 Audio channel ordering](../../9-raw-media-interfaces/9.3-audio-sample-format/9.3.3-audio-channel-ordering.md). The [`AudioData`](#audiodata) has a number of planes equal to the [`AudioData`](#audiodata)’s [`[[number of channels]]`](#dom-audiodata-number-of-channels-slot). Each plane contains [`[[number of frames]]`](#dom-audiodata-number-of-frames-slot) elements.

NOTE: The [Web Audio API](#biblio-webaudio "Web Audio API") currently uses [`f32-planar`](#dom-audiosampleformat-f32-planar) exclusively.

NOTE: The following diagram exemplifies the memory layout of [planar](#planar) versus [interleaved](#interleaved) [`AudioSampleFormat`](#enumdef-audiosampleformat)s

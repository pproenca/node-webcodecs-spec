combined buffer layout [struct](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#struct)

-   A allocationSize (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))
    
-   A computedLayouts (a [list](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list) of [computed plane layout](#computed-plane-layout) structs).
    

A computed plane layout is a [struct](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#struct) that consists of:

-   A destinationOffset (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))
    
-   A destinationStride (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))
    
-   A sourceTop (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))
    
-   A sourceHeight (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))
    
-   A sourceLeftBytes (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))
    
-   A sourceWidthBytes (an [`unsigned long`](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-unsigned-long))

Sub-sampling is a technique where a single sample contains information for multiple pixels in the final image. [Sub-sampling](#sub-sampling) can be horizontal, vertical or both, and has a factor, that is the number of final pixels in the image that are derived from a [sub-sampled](#sub-sampling) sample.

[](#example-33b7b945)If a [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) is in [`I420`](#dom-videopixelformat-i420) format, then the very first component of the second plane (the U plane) corresponds to four pixels, that are the pixels in the top-left angle of the image. Consequently, the first component of the second row corresponds to the four pixels below those initial four top-left pixels. The [sub-sampling factor](#sub-sampling-factor) is 2 in both the horizontal and vertical direction.

If a [`VideoPixelFormat`](#enumdef-videopixelformat) has an alpha component, the format’s equivalent opaque format is the same [`VideoPixelFormat`](#enumdef-videopixelformat), without an alpha component. If a [`VideoPixelFormat`](#enumdef-videopixelformat) does not have an alpha component, it is its own [equivalent opaque format](#equivalent-opaque-format).

Integer values are unsigned unless otherwise specified.

: This format is composed of a single plane, that encodes four components: Blue, Green, Red, and a padding value, present in this order.

Each sample in this format is 8 bits. The fourth element in each pixel is to be ignored, the image is always fully opaque.

There are [`codedWidth`](#dom-videoframe-codedwidth) \* [`codedHeight`](#dom-videoframe-codedheight) \* 4 samples (and therefore bytes) in the single plane, arranged starting at the top left of the image, in [`codedHeight`](#dom-videoframe-codedheight) rows of [`codedWidth`](#dom-videoframe-codedwidth) samples.

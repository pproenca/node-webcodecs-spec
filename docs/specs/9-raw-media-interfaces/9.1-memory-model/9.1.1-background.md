# 9.1.1. Background

This section is non-normative.

Decoded media data _MAY_ occupy a large amount of system memory. To minimize the need for expensive copies, this specification defines a scheme for reference counting (`clone()` and `close()`).

NOTE: Authors are encouraged to call `close()` immediately when frames are no longer needed.

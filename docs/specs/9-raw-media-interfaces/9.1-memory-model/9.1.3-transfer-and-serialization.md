# 9.1.3. Transfer and Serialization

This section is non-normative.

[`AudioData`](#audiodata) and [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) are both [transferable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/structured-data.html#transferable-objects) and [serializable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/structured-data.html#serializable-objects) objects. Their transfer and serialization steps are defined in [§ 9.2.6 Transfer and Serialization](../../9-raw-media-interfaces/9.2-audiodata-interface/9.2.6-transfer-and-serialization.md) and [§ 9.4.7 Transfer and Serialization](../../9-raw-media-interfaces/9.4-videoframe-interface/9.4.7-transfer-and-serialization.md) respectively.

Transferring an [`AudioData`](#audiodata) or [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) moves its `[[resource reference]]` to the destination object and closes (as in [`close()`](#dom-audiodata-close)) the source object. Authors _MAY_ use this facility to move an [`AudioData`](#audiodata) or [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) between realms without copying the underlying [media resource](#media-resource).

Serializing an [`AudioData`](#audiodata) or [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) effectively clones (as in [`clone()`](#dom-videoframe-clone)) the source object, resulting in two objects that reference the same [media resource](#media-resource). Authors _MAY_ use this facility to clone an [`AudioData`](#audiodata) or [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) to another realm without copying the underlying [media resource](#media-resource).

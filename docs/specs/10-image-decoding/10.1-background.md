# 10.1. Background

This section is non-normative.

Image codec definitions are typically accompanied by a definition for a corresponding file format. Hence image decoders often perform both duties of unpacking (demuxing) as well as decoding the encoded image data. The WebCodecs [`ImageDecoder`](#imagedecoder) follows this pattern, which motivates an interface design that is notably different from that of [`VideoDecoder`](#videodecoder) and [`AudioDecoder`](#audiodecoder).

In spite of these differences, [`ImageDecoder`](#imagedecoder) uses the same [codec processing model](#codec-processing-model) as the other codec interfaces. Additionally, [`ImageDecoder`](#imagedecoder) uses the [`VideoFrame`](#videoframe) interface to describe decoded outputs.

# 10.4. ImageDecodeOptions Interface

```webidl
dictionary ImageDecodeOptions {
  [EnforceRange] unsigned long frameIndex = 0;
  boolean completeFramesOnly = true;
};
```
**frameIndex, of type unsigned long, defaulting to 0**
: The index of the frame to decode.

**completeFramesOnly, of type boolean, defaulting to true**
: For [Progressive Images](#progressive-image), a value of `false` indicates that the decoder _MAY_ output an [`image`](#dom-imagedecoderesult-image) with reduced detail. Each subsequent call to [`decode()`](#dom-imagedecoder-decode) for the same [`frameIndex`](#dom-imagedecodeoptions-frameindex) will resolve to produce an image with a higher [Progressive Image Frame Generation](#progressive-image-frame-generation) (more image detail) than the previous call, until finally the full-detail image is produced.

If [`completeFramesOnly`](#dom-imagedecodeoptions-completeframesonly) is assigned `true`, or if the image is not a [Progressive Image](#progressive-image), or if the User Agent does not support progressive decoding for the given image type, calls to [`decode()`](#dom-imagedecoder-decode) will only resolve once the full detail image is decoded.

NOTE: For [Progressive Images](#progressive-image), setting [`completeFramesOnly`](#dom-imagedecodeoptions-completeframesonly) to `false` can be used to offer users a preview an image that is still being buffered from the network (via the [`data`](#dom-imagedecoderinit-data) [`ReadableStream`](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#readablestream)).

Upon decoding the full detail image, the [`ImageDecodeResult`](#dictdef-imagedecoderesult)’s [`complete`](#dom-imagedecoderesult-complete) will be set to true.

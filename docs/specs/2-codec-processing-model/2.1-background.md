# 2.1. Background

This section is non-normative.

The codec interfaces defined by the specification are designed such that new codec tasks can be scheduled while previous tasks are still pending. For example, web authors can call `decode()` without waiting for a previous `decode()` to complete. This is achieved by offloading underlying codec tasks to a separate [parallel queue](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#parallel-queue) for parallel execution.

This section describes threading behaviors as they are visible from the perspective of web authors. Implementers can choose to use more threads, as long as the externally visible behaviors of blocking and sequencing are maintained as follows.

Our goal is to have a one to one, line by line equivalent implementation between JavaScript and Rust. Search for all the TODO in the codebase and
  implement them. It may require some large refactor or infrastructure changes. You are authorized to do them, do NOT skip them for easier tasks. Do not give up. I will run this
  prompt again and again so you have all the time in the world to do the right thing. Make sure it still compiles after each addition and commit and push to git. Document the
  fixes in TODO_PROGRESS.md.
